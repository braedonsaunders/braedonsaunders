# Hey, I'm Braedon 👋

I build developer tools that solve problems I've actually had.

### What I'm working on

🔀 **[CodeFlow](https://github.com/braedonsaunders/codeflow)** — Paste any GitHub URL, get an interactive architecture map of the codebase. No install, no signup, runs entirely in your browser. One HTML file.

🧹 **[Sloppy](https://github.com/braedonsaunders/sloppy)** — AI code cleanup that doesn't stop after one pass. Free GitHub Action — scans every PR, scores your code 0-100, and optionally auto-fixes with Claude or Codex. No API key needed for scans.

⚾ **[Homerun](https://github.com/braedonsaunders/homerun)** — Autonomous arbitrage scanner for Polymarket prediction markets. 18 strategies, 3 trading modes, real-time dashboard. Finds mathematically guaranteed profit windows.
